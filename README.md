# Bryan's Wicked Good Ruby code slides

Here's the code. It was written to demo, and not to share, so there are 
a few caveats. I hardcoded some paths in src/classification. 

You'll have to install libsvm. I installed it from Mac homebrew. I also
didn't create Gemfiles. I believe I used chunky_png, rb-libsvm, and
sinatra.

To run the clustering gnuplot examples, you'll need gnuplot. The files
have a .txt extension and can be run like: `gnuplot < file.txt`
